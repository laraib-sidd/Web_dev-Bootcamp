element
element, element
element element(It means the element inside the element.)
element > element(It means all the parent abilities apply to child elemnts.)
element1 + element2(It measn the element2 is after element1 than only apply styling.)
:hover(when you add this to the selector the style only occurs when you hover the cursor over it.)
:last-child (Selects the last child in the selector.)
:first-child(Selects the first child in the selector.)
!important (not recommended)(It makes all the other property obsolete.)
